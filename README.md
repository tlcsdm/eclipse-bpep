# Builder Pattern Eclipse Plugin

This project is a Eclipse plugin that automates the writing of these builders. With just two clicks you can generate all the builder code you need.

## About
The Builder Pattern was first introduced by Joshua Bloch at JavaOne 2007. It's a pattern for class creation and helps getting rid of ugly constructors, constructor telescoping and increases the general readability of your code.

Fork of the bpep plugin. Original source: https://github.com/henningjensen/bpep

## Use
In the eclipse java editor window, right click and select Source -> Generate Builder Pattern Code or Ctrl + Alt + P.

Then select which fields you want to expose in the builder.
